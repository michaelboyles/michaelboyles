**About me:**<br/>
Name: Michael<br/>
Age: 29<br/>
Profession: Software developer

I'm mainly a ![java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelboyles/michaelboyles/master/images/java.gif) developer. Some
JavaScript & React too. I've written C++ and PHP professionally in the past and I'd rather not do that again.

I'm interested in source code and bytecode generation as an alternative to reflection-based frameworks. Iï¿½m liking
the direction [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/)'s authors are taking.
                                                                                                           
I have a professional interest in [FIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Information_eXchange) even though it's
objectively quite boring.
